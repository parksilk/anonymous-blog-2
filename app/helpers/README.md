## Issue Tracker:
- Tags should NOT save if there are other errors with the post information.
- Users should be able to edit posts
x Current info the user has typed should persist when there are errors!












Add helpers here as *.rb files, e.g.,

app/helpers/formatting.rb

helpers do
  def em(text)
    "<em>#{text}</em>"
  end
end
